# Robotic Arm Controller

Control a 3D-printed robotic arm using **two different input methods**:

- **Hand Gestures Picked up by your Camera**
- **Standard Game Controller (e.g. PlayStation Controller)**

To be built in C++. Purpose is to apply code to the 'real world.'

---

## Control Modes

## Hand Gesture Controller
Uses a webcame to interpret hand gestures and translate them into arm movements.

- **Library used**:

## Game Controller
The controller interface uses D-pad and button inputs to control the joints of the robotic arm in real time.

- **Uses OpenCV**
- gesture control to be determined

# Robotic Arm Controller

Control a 3D-printed robotic arm using **two different input methods**:

- **Hand Gestures Picked up by your Camera**
- **Standard Keyboard Controller**

Purpose is to apply code to the 'real world.' E.g. Industrial Robots.

---

## Control Modes

## Hand Gesture Controller
Uses a webcam to interpret hand gestures and translate them into arm movements.

# Keyboard Controller
Detects keyboard input and deploys the information that moves the robotic arm. 

- **Requirements**:
PlatformIO IDE


## Game Controller
The controller interface uses D-pad and button inputs to control the joints of the robotic arm in real time.

- **Uses OpenCV**
- gesture control to be determined
